# LC Difficulty Hider
- Its purpose is to divert your attention from the predefined difficulty level associated with LeetCode problems.
- The goal is to encourage an open mindset when approaching each problem, free from preconceived notions about its difficulty.
- By temporarily concealing the difficulty level, the extension aims to simulate a real-life scenario where challenges are approached without predetermined expectations.
- The extension has been tested and verified to work seamlessly on both Firefox and Chrome browsers.
